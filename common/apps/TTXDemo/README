This simple demo samples an accelerometer forwards it to a PC and
displays fever curves on a screen. It has 3 parts:
 * PC_display
 * SampleForwardNode
 * SampleForwardBase

SampleForward
=============

The node samples continuously and forwards the packets using the
radio. The node currently only runs on Sensinode Nano with
accelerometer board.

The base receives the packets and prints them on the serial port for
the display app.


PC_display
==========

Runs 3 graphs that read from a fifo each and a perl script that reads
from the serial port and writes to the fifos. Start by starting the
graphs with "start_meter" and the reader with "ttxdemo.pl"

trend: with the -f d it reasds "binary doubles" with no delimiter from
 the fifo

start_meter.sh
 creates n fifos and starts a trend window for each
