	* hist-spec now uses "x" instead of "*".

	* Grid enhancements/offsetting.


Rev #23 29/10/2004 to Rev #27 02/11/2004
========================================

	* Incorrectly initialised buffers could cause interactive
	indicators to malfunction for first values.

	* 'A' re-scales the graph without activating auto-scaling.


Rev #20 21/10/2004 to Rev #23 29/10/2004
========================================

	* Optimisations and huge internal latency reductions.

	* Fixed precision truncation in auto-scaling.

	* Fixed scrolling mode for "history" non multiple of "divisions".

	* Created a support/testing mailing list. See README for details.

	* All options have a command line flag now.

	* current/min/max values can be shown on the graph.

	* New shading mode.
