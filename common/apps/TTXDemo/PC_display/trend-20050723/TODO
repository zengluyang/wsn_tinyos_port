Planned features
================

	* Multiple trends in a single graph. I'd appreciate comments on that
	(how the interface should respond, where to place the values, etc:
	I don't feel the idea "intuitive" or very convenient anymore).

	* More optimisations can be done for: different shading modes,
	different input types.

	* Maybe some basic oscilloscope controls like: graph offsetting,
	zooming, value skipping.
