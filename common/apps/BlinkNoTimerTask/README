BlinkNoTimerTask
================
A minimalistic application that blinks timers using a delayloop. This
application is much simpler than the Blink application from the man
TinyOS distribution which requires operational timers.

In adition it uses a task as opposed to Blink, since at least 1 task
is required by the TinyOS 8051wg port.
