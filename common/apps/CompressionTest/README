CompressionTest
======================================================================

This application tests the the compression algorithms in the
compression library. It has a node side (CompressionTest) and PC side
(node-comm). The PC side reads data from a text file, transmits it to
the mote using a UART. The mote stores it in a buffer, compressed it
and sends it back. The default chunk size that CompressionTest reads
is 256 bytes, and the mote as default stores and compresses 16 chunks
(4096~bytes).

The data read by node-comm must be stored in a simple but specific
file format (see below).

* CompessionTest

In order to build this application setup an algorithm by linking one
of the algorithm ".h" files to compressor.h in lib/compression (see
lib/compression/README for more). Compile and upload your application
to the mote.

To test if the beast is a live open a termninal and type "p" it should
respond with "pong".

* node-comm

The PC side of the CompressionTest application it transmits the data
read from the data file. It accepts a few parameters to controll the
process. For exaple one could run the following:

  ./node-comm data.csv -d /dev/ttyUSB1 -s230400 -r 10

Available options are:

./node-comm -h
Usage: node-comm input-file [-d device] [-s speed] [-r runs] [-o ouput file]

 -h             This help message
 -d             The serial device to communicate with the mote
 -s             The transfer rate of the serial device (speed) 
 -r             Maximum number of blocks to compress
 -o             Output file


* File format
The format consists of 7 fields separated by ;
  1.   Timestamp of the form \d+\.\d{3}
  2.   Sequence number: \d+
  3-7. 5 RAW adc samples: -?\d+
