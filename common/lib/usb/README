USB Stack for TinyOS

This directory contains a simple USB stack for TinyOS. It was
developed for the SiLabs c808051f34x, but it should general enough to
encompass any device with a built in USB port. Each such system will
have to provide a USBControl interface and all endpoints using
USBEndpoint interfaces.

We provide a USB serial port emulator (conforming to the
Communications Class Device - CDC) that should work with any operating
system claiming to support USB. The implementation is split in two: a
byte level and a packet level interface.

The byte level version is limited in performance due to the way the
individual bytes are tranferred over the USB bus: each
SerialByteComm.put() results in one USB packet per byte, the USB
packets are spaced one per ms. Essentially limiting the outbound
bandwidth to 8 kbit. This means that for example a simple echo
application will fail horribly if the bytes are transmitted to the
device at full speed, since it will not be able to return bytes at the
same rate.

The driver is setup in the following heirachy (using the serial driver
as example):


                       |SerialByteComm
  +--------------------+--------------------------+
  |               USBSerialCDC                    |
  +--------------------+--------------------------+
                       | PacketComm
  +--------------------+--------------------------+
  |            USBCommunicationClassDevice        |
  +--------+-----------------+----------+---------+
           | USBDevice       |          |
  +--------+--------------+  |          |
  |   USBControlEndpoint  |  |Endpoint1 |Endpoint2
  +-+-----------+---------+  |          |
    |USBControl |Endpoint0   |          |

examples and secondly a CDC implementation provided in the Cygnal
