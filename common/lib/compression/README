Compression
======================================================================

This is a simple library to compress 3 samples using one of 4
algorihms. It uses an internal buffer that must be copies to a
separate location for transmission, storrate, etc.

You can include this in your own applications and test it using
CompressionTest (apps/CompresisonTest). See readme file in this
directory for more.

To use this compression library:
 * link "compressor.h" to one of the available algorithms (in the lib
   directory):
     lz77.h simple.h huffman.h huffman_diff.h huffman_whole.h passthru.h

 * Include the interface "Compressor" in your application and wire it
   to CompressorM.nc

 * Call Compressor.Init() from "Booted"

 * Each consecutive call to "Compress" stores the samples in an
   interneal buffer until its full (default size = 256 bytes).

    * When the buffer is full the Compressor.bufferFull event is
      signaled. In this event the content must be copied since it will
      be overwritten by Compress on the next call.

    * To return the buffer earlier call "Compressor.flush" - its
      unclear how to figure out how many bytes are present in the
      buffer in this case
