StdOut
======
A minimalisting prety printing library (not entirely unlike printf).
By wiring to the StdOutC components will be able to print human
readable text to the UART defined for the platform in UartC. To
disable printing the application can later wire to StdNull;

In addition to printing strings the interface provides methods for
printing integers in different bases: base 16 (hex), base 10, base 2
(binary).

The strings are copied to an internal print buffer, but no concurrency
checks are performed - if a program call print to often the output
will be garbled.
