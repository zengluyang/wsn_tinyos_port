Transparent log recording layer.

The log recording layer is used to record the accumulated time used in
different mote states, such as on, transmitting, receiving, etc. The
states are numbered by connecting I/O pins from one pin two an other
and recording the time spent in each state on the second mote.

The recording layer has two parts:
 1. The library in this directory that is to be linked with a target
    application and used on a target mote
 2. The LogRecorder application in the apps directory. This application
    records the state transitions on the target mote via the I/O pins.


To use this on a target application:

 * Change the top level wiring file to point to the log-component
   instead of the real components. For example to record the use of
   the Msp430 internal temperature sensor:

  components new Msp430InternalTemperatureC();
  components new ReadLoggerC(uint16_t);
  DataAcquisitionP.Read -> ReadLoggerC;
  ReadLoggerC.ReadIn -> Msp430InternalTemperatureC;

 * Link log.extra to support/make/<your platform>/

 * make <your platform> log

Which output pins are bound to which states is configured in the component
"LoggerPinsC" found in the platform directory.
