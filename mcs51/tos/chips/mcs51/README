1. Description
====================================================================

This directory contains a generic implementation of the most commenly 
seen devices shared among many 8051 variants. At the time of writing this
one of the popular availabe software blocks for SoC production is the
the DW8051 MacroCell from Synopsys. This is known to be used by the nRF24E1
devcie, and is likely to be used in other devices.

In addition there is a bunch of dummy system includes to provent NescC
from including the ones from libc (which won't work with Keil).
